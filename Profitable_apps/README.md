# Profitable app profiles for the app store and google play markets

Our aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. For companies that only build apps that are free to download and install, their main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that their revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use their app. Our objective is to analyze data to help developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.
